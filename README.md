# Notion Calendar Tracker 
Notion is a productivity app I use regularly. It has so many kinds of data storage options - to-do lists, calendars, Kanban boards, etc. They recently released an API that allows you to fetch data from your Notion app using a secret token (just like you would connect to a database like MongoDB). This is a website that uses the notion API to retrieve data from my notion calendar where I update all the important college activities and displays it. The possibilities are endless and you can almost use it as a CMS :P

I've used React to make the UI, and Node and Express to set up the backend server that fetches data from my Notion app.

### To check it out
Fork/Clone and 'npm run dev' which runs the backend server on port 5000 and the frontend react app on 3000
